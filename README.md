# posim
Posim is a customizable harbour porpoise individual-based model bundled as an R-package using Rcpp. Posim allows you to to run an individual based simulation model (IBM) for fine-scale movements and population dynamics of harbour porpoises in a customizable landscape. The landscape may feature gillnets, in which porpoises can get entangled. The model is an extension and reimplementation of Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013) and Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2014). The original model was extended to add gillnets, and reimplemented in C++ (from NetLogo) to allow for faster execution. Please see these references for a detailed description of how movements and population dynamics are modeled.

posim is being cleaned up and will be available shortly.

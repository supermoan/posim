# posim
Posim is a customizable harbour porpoise individual-based model bundled as an R-package using Rcpp. Posim allows you to to run an individual based simulation model (IBM) for fine-scale movements and population dynamics of harbour porpoises in a customizable landscape. The landscape may feature gillnets, in which porpoises can get entangled. The model is an extension and reimplementation of Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2013) and Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2014). The original model was extended to add gillnets, and reimplemented in C++ (from NetLogo) to allow for faster execution. Please see these references for a detailed description of how movements and population dynamics are modeled.

Disclaimer: Posim version 0.1 should be considered as in development. Posim has only been compiled on a Macbook Pro on OSX 12.5.1 using R version 4.1.2 and Rcpp version 1.0.7. There is no guarantees that it will compile on any other system, or indeed on any other computer. 

In the future, posim will be cleaned up!
